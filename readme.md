# Mail in python

Hello, I am José Antonio Rodríguez, from Granada.

This is a short project for one subject called `Development Client Environment`.

## About the project
**ONLY WORKS WITH GMAIL**

Our teacher [Ale Cortés](https://twitter.com/Kirzahk), sent us this project.
It's simple to use, just run the python code in an IDE and then, enter [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

#### How to use
First of all you have to disable the **mail security** [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwio26e4kuj0AhWxy4UKHWWvAnAQFnoECA0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmyaccount.google.com%2Flesssecureapps&usg=AOvVaw3FH1O5TwzTEB9B9yhEUsI7)

Here you have a test mail:
- **Mail:** pythontestwithale@gmail.com
- **Password:** Python3WithAle

I know it's not perfect, but I'm working while studiying and I'm short of time, so I had to do it so fast, sorry :sweat_smile:

#### What I used on this project:
- Jquery (3.6.0)
- Python3
- HTML
- CSS

## About me
I'm a junior developer who study at [EIG](https://esgerencia.com/) and working at [Novatec](https://www.novatec-gmbh.de/en/).
